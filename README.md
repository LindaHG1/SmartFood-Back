<h2>Development process</h2>
<p>I developed a web application using React that incorporated various Google services such as Google Calendar, Google Maps, and Google My Business. The goal of the web application was to help a company scale their business to the digital world and expand their client base.

Working with a team of developers, I implemented Google's API and ensured that the application functioned properly. I also designed the user experience and user interface for the web application, following agile methodologies to ensure a streamlined and user-friendly experience for users. Collaborating with designers, I created wireframes and mockups for the web application, and implemented the final designs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

As part of the development process, I also troubleshooted technical issues and worked closely with the project manager to ensure that the project was completed on time and within budget. I participated in code reviews and provided feedback to other team members to ensure that code was clean, efficient, and followed best practices.

To gather requirements and provide updates on the project's progress, I communicated with stakeholders. I also documented the development process and created user manuals to assist users in navigating the web application.

Overall, the web application served as a valuable tool for the company to expand their reach and connect with new clients in the digital world. Through the incorporation of Google services, the application provided a seamless experience for users, allowing them to easily access the company's services and offerings. My skills in communication, leadership, SQL, user interface design, responsive web design, soft skills, web applications, analytical skills, programming, full-stack development, and software development were all utilized throughout the project to ensure its success.</p>
